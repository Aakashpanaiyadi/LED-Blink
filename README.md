# LED-Blink
ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This project is written in Embedded C for a PIC microcontroller and tested in Proteus simulation software. The program controls LEDs connected to PORTB of the PIC, creating different LED patterns using simple delay loops.

ðŸ”¹ How it Works

Blinking â€“ All LEDs on PORTB turn ON and OFF repeatedly.

Ascending Pattern â€“ LEDs turn ON one by one from left to right.

Descending Pattern â€“ LEDs turn ON one by one from right to left.

Outer to Center Pattern â€“ LEDs light up starting from the outer ends and move towards the center.

Center to Outer Pattern â€“ LEDs light up starting from the center and move towards the outer ends.

A simple delay function is used to control the speed of LED transitions.

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used

PIC Microcontroller (with pic.h library)

Proteus for simulation

MPLAB / XC8 (or similar) for code compilation
