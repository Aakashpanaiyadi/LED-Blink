# LED-Blink
Project Description

This project is written in Embedded C for a PIC microcontroller and tested in Proteus simulation software. The program controls LEDs connected to PORTB of the PIC, creating different LED patterns using simple delay loops.

How it Works

Blinking – All LEDs on PORTB turn ON and OFF repeatedly.

Ascending Pattern – LEDs turn ON one by one from left to right.

Descending Pattern – LEDs turn ON one by one from right to left.

Outer to Center Pattern – LEDs light up starting from the outer ends and move towards the center.

Center to Outer Pattern – LEDs light up starting from the center and move towards the outer ends.

A simple delay function is used to control the speed of LED transitions.

Tools Used

PIC Microcontroller (with pic.h library)

Proteus for simulation

MPLAB / XC8 (or similar) for code compilation
